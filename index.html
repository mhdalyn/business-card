                    <p>I live in Canal Winchester, Ohio. I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology from The Ohio State University, and am working on a software development career program with <a href="thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>.</p>           
                    <p>Here is a list of some of the things I enjoy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Video, board, and role-playing Games</li>
                        <li>Spending time with my family, friends, and pets</li>
                        <li>Reading and learning new things, especially history or technology (bonus points for both!)</li>
                        <li>Teaching and helping people</li>
                        <li>Fencing</li>
                        <li>Hiking</li>

                        <h2>About me</h2>
                    </header>
            
                    <p>I have always had a love for working with computers, and also working on a team. The more I learn about software development, the more programming, and the agile development method seems like the perfect fit for me. In work environments, I thrive as part of a team, have excellent communication skills, and my desire to help others succeed along with my love of learning often results in my assuming a position of leadership and/or expertise on those teams. I have completed coursework towards a programming degree, and any time I've had to take a break from coding, coming back to it feels like catching up with an old friend. Thus far, my experience with programming languages is as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                    </ol>
